     <h3 id="headline"> <h3>Who was Rene Magritte?</h3>
     <span><b>Rene Magritte</b> was an internationally acclaimed surrealist artist of all time, yet it was not until his 50s, when he was finally able to reach some form of fame and recognition for his work. Rene Magritte described his paintings saying, "My painting is visible images which conceal nothing; they evoke mystery and, indeed, when one sees one of my pictures, one asks oneself this simple question, 'What does that mean?' It does not mean anything, because mystery means nothing, it is unknowable." </span><br><br><br>
   
   <section id="tribute-info"></section>
  <h2 id="headline"><h2> A few quick facts</h2><br><br>
  <ul type=circle>
<ul> <li>Rene Magritte was born in Lessines, Belgium in 1898. Although little is known about his early life, we do know he began drawing in 1910 at the tender age of 12.</li><br>
  <li>From 1916 to 1918, Rene decided to study at the <em>Academie des Beaux-Art</em>, which was located in Brussels. He left the school, because he thought that it was a waste of time. All his paintings afterward reflect cubism, the movements which were introduced by Pablo Picasso and was very popular at the time. In 1922 he married Georgette, and took a number of small jobs, including painting cabbage roses for a wallpaper company, in order to be able to pay the bills.</li><br>
  <li>Magritte's 1964 The Son of Man, which features a bowler-hatted subject's face shrouded by a hovering green apple and is ostensibly his most famous piece, was really created as a self-portrait! I found this to be very interesting as there is usealy s story behind an artists self-portrait.</li><br>
  <li> Magritte's works have grown so recognizable in the period after his death in 1967 that they can't even be stolen, as a group of thieves discovered in 2009. Hilariously,they were unable to sell his ¬£3.6 million work, <em>Olympia</em>, on the black market after liberating it, with possible buyers arguing it was too recognizable to acquire. Three years later, the painting was dutifully returned to the Magritte Museum in perfect condition.</li><br>
   <li> Brussels, where Magritte spent much of his life, named a street <em>Ceci n‚Äôest pas une rue</em> meaning <b>This is not a street</b> after his most famous work, <em>The Treachery of Images.</em></li><br>
  <li> Magritte spent much of his free time, in addition to his professional interests, experimenting with photography, and while his images were never viewed with the same veneration as his paintings, they did play a role in inspiring his later works. <br><br>
 <li> Now that we've got the history out of the way let's look at some of his most famous pieces of art - and the first one coming up is one I've wanted for a very long time on a wall in my house...

         alt="Empire of Light, 1950"/><br>
 
   <p>
     In 1953-1954, artist Rene Magritte painted The Empire of Lights. It is the only time that Magritte used a title that was not his own.<br><br> The intriguing oil painting displays a beautiful house lit up by its interior lights, and surrounded by the darkness of the night. Especially surreal is that the sky above the house and treeline is a daytime sky full of brightness and plump white clouds. <br><br>It is a serene, mysterious scene. In Empire of Light, numerous versions of which exist, a dark, nocturnal street scene is set against a pastel-blue, light-drenched sky spotted with fluffy cumulus clouds. With no fantastic element other than the single paradoxical combination of day and night, Ren√© Magritte upsets a fundamental organizing premise of life. Sunlight, ordinarily the source of clarity, here causes the confusion and unease traditionally associated with darkness. <br><br>The luminosity of the sky becomes unsettling, making the empty darkness below even more impenetrable than it would seem in a normal context. The bizarre subject is treated in an impersonal, precise style, typical of veristic Surrealist painting and preferred by Magritte since the mid-1920s.

        alt="The Human Condition, 1933"/><br>
<p>
  Two of Magritte's favored themes were the "window painting" and the "painting within a painting." The Human Condition is one of Magritte's earliest treatments of either subject, and in it he combines the two, making what may be his most subtle and profound statement of their shared meaning.
<b>The Human Condition<b> displays an easel placed inside a room and in front of a window. The easel holds an unframed painting of a landscape that seems in every detail contiguous with the landscape seen outside the window. <br><br>At first, one automatically assumes that the painting on the easel depicts the portion of the landscape outside the window that it hides from view. After a moment's consideration, however, one realizes that this assumption is based upon a false premise: that is, that the imagery of Magritte's painting is real, while the painting on the easel is a representation of that reality. In fact, there is no difference between them. Both are part of the same painting, the same artistic fabrication. It is perhaps to this repeating cycle, in which the viewer, even against his will, sees the one as real and the other as representation, that Magritte's title makes reference.</p>

        alt="On the Threshold of Liberty, 1937"/><Br>
<p>
  On the Threshold of Liberty is a controversial piece by Ren√© Magritte. It is a prime example of pre-world war two surrealism, which is also an example of the fusion of pre-surrealism/post-dada movement: a modal intermediate between 'anti-art' and the expressionistic ideas of dreams presented by the works of Carl Jung that symbols have meaning based in dreams.<br> <br> Through these ideas of semiotic studies, the expressionism used with varied images to convey surreal contortion of art, making use of dream images fused into paintings. It was a common element to use the 'collective conscious' idea as a mantra for painting in the surrealist movement: creating a fabricated reality with no coherent meaning other than what the observer created.</p> <br><br>
