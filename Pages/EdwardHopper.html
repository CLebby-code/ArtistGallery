 <h3 id="headline"> <h3>Who was Edward Hopper?</h3>
 <span><b>Edward Hopper</b> is renowed worldwide as the most important realist painter of twentieth Century America. His fascinating vision of reality was selective and often reflected his own temperament. His choice to paint empty cityscapes, landscapes and isolated figures is proof of this, and his work clearly demonstrates that realism is not merely a photographic or literal copying of what we see, rather it's an interpretive rendering. </span><br><br><br>

  <h2 id="headline"><h2> A few quick facts</h2><br><br>
  <ul type=circle>
<ul> <li>Edaward Hopper was born in Edward Hopper was born in 1882, in NY, into a middle-class family. From 1900 to 1906 he studied at the NY School of Art, and while in school, shifted from illustration to works of fine art.</li><br><br>
  <li>Upon completing his schooling, he worked as an illustrator for a short period of time; once this career path ended, he made three international trips, which had a great influence on the future of his work, and the type of art he would engage in during the course of his career.</li><br>
  <li>Oil painting was a focal point of the work he had done, but a majority of the sales he made during this period, was for works he had created doing etching work and murals.</li><br>
  <li>His highly identifiable style, and mature painting styles, were some things he had become known for during this period. The gorgeous landscapes, the quiet rooms and empty rooms he designed, and the transitory effect which many of his works posed, created a sense of contemporary life and a new style, which many in the art world recognized, and many praised him for this distinct style he had created in his art forms. </li> <br><br>
 <li> Now that we've got the history out of the way let's look at some of his most famous pieces of art - and the first one coming up is truly special for many reasons....

        <figcaption>Nighthawks, 1942</figcaption><br>
<p>Nighthawks is a 1942 painting by Edward Hopper that portrays people sitting in a downtown diner late at night. It is Hopper's most famous work and is one of the most recognizable paintings in American art.<br> Within months of its completion, it was sold to the Art Institute of Chicago for $3,000, and has remained there ever since. <br>Nighthawks was probably Hopper's most ambitious essay in capturing the night-time effects of manmade light. For one thing, the diner's plate-glass windows cause far more light to spill out onto the sidewalk and the brownstones on the far side of the street than is true in any of his other paintings. As well, this interior light comes from more than a single lightbulb, with the result that multiple shadows are cast, and some spots are brighter than others as a consequence of being lit from more than one angle. Across the street, the line of shadow caused by the upper edge of the diner window is clearly visible towards the top of the painting. These windows, and the ones below them as well, are partly lit by an unseen streetlight, which projects its own mix of light and shadow. As a final note, the bright interior light causes some of the surfaces within the diner to be reflective. This is clearest in the case of the right-hand edge of the rear window, which reflects a vertical yellow band of interior wall, but fainter reflections can also be made out, in the counter-top, of three of the diner's occupants. None of these reflections would be visible in daylight.</p>

        <figcaption>Automat, 1927</figcaption><br>
 <p>Automat was first displayed on Valentine's Day 1927 at the opening of Hopper's second solo show, at the Rehn Galleries in New York. By April it had been sold for $1,200. The painting is today owned by the Des Moines Art Center in Iowa.<br>The painting portrays a lone woman staring into a cup of coffee in an Automat at night. The reflection of identical rows of light fixtures stretches out through the night-blackened window.<br>As is often the case in Hopper's paintings, both the woman's circumstances and her mood are ambiguous. She is well-dressed and is wearing makeup, which could indicate either that she is on her way to or from work at a job where personal appearance is important, or that she is on her way to or from a social occasion.<br>She has removed only one glove, which may indicate either that she is distracted, that she is in a hurry and can stop only for a moment, or simply that she has just come in from outside, and has not yet warmed up. But the latter possibility seems unlikely, for there is a small empty plate on the table, in front of her cup and saucer, suggesting that she may have eaten a snack and been sitting at this spot for some time.
<br>Hopper would make the crossed legs of a female subject the brightest spot on an otherwise dark canvas in a number of later paintings, including Compartment C, Car (1938) and Hotel Lobby (1943). The female subject of his 1931 painting Barber Shop is also in a pose similar to the woman in Automat, and the viewer's image of her is similarly bisected by a table. But the placing of the subject in a bright, populated place, at midday, makes the woman less isolated and vulnerable, and hence the viewer's gaze seems less intrusive. </p>
